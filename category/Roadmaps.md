Physics is vast, and it can seem daunting at first sight to even get started with a topic. There is often this lingering feeling of self-doubt as to whether you're sufficiently proficient in the prerequisites to make actual headway. Some people rush too fast, picking up difficult-to-shake misconceptions, and not being able to fully appreciate or join the dots in that subject (nothing inherently wrong with that of course, but not useful if one is seeking to build up a solid understanding). Indeed, it is essential to 

On the other hand, there are some people who are too heavy-handed while recommending prerequisites, and this only makes physics seem overly formidable and disheartening while starting out. 

That's why I've tried to prepare a list of prerequisites, concurrent topics and intriguing areas to sidetrack in, for most of the high-energy physics learning route, based on my own (subjective, of course) experience. I've had the experience of self-learning most of these topics, and so I feel I can offer some slightly different perspectives than the mainstream advice. Although I won't explicitly be recommending many textbooks, I advise that you do not stick to a single one, and only opt for etsblished books which are at least 5-10 years old.
