title: Programming
---

Long before I was learning physics, I was doing programming! My first foray into the coding universe was when I picked up Microsoft *Small Basic* when I was around 7. The precise details of how I chanced upon it currently elude me, but I was really into mathematics at that time, and so I viewed programming as both a recreational offshoot and a (perhaps lucrative) opportunity to make video games. My very first program was a quizI have vivid memories of discovering what a for loop was shortly after working out how long it would take me to copy-paste and edit 200,000 lines of if-statements.  

Later on I was taught C, at age 9, and then I self-learnt Java by reading the two volumes in the *Core Java* series by Cay Horstmann and Gary Cornell (the second edition, printed circa 2000!). Learning programming languages became something of a pastime after that, and I am now also conversant in C++, Rust and, despite the repeated insistence of my younger self that it was not a "real" language, Python (spoiler alert: I love it now). For a long period, I was intent on becoming a game developer, and so I have many game projects in Unity strewn around too. I also enjoy app development, particularly in Flutter.

The *extended* projects I have undertaken include a chess engine, a physics engine and a machine learning library, all of which have undergone substantial rewrites and transcriptions into multiple languages. My other favourites include an editor and simulator for Conway's Game of Life (discrete *and* smooth!), an FFT-based noise reduction, quantum chemistry calculations of observables in helium, a quantum tunnelling simulation, a ray tracer, and an ASCII art generator. I'm looking to expand my repertoire in harcore scientific programming, since I sense it'll be very handy in the future.
