## Stack Exchange

My main presence on the Internet is currently through the [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) group of sites, predominantly the [Physics Stack Exchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/). It's the greatest physics Q&A site on the internet, with contributions from enthusiasts, undergrad, grad and PhD students, and working professionals in the field. I find it a fantastic source of physics knowledge, and I also do my bit to answer questions, predominantly in quantum field theory, string theory and some general relativity. They have a unique "reputation" system (read: internet points), and I pride myself in that I am among the top 300 users overall. Here are some of my answers:

- [*Anomalies, Symmetries and the Ward Identity*](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/629890/231159)
- [Strings as a UV regulator](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/638676/231159)
- [WZW Model on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/645893/231159)
- [Features of dynamical D-branes](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/631660/231159)

## Github

I have uploaded a few projects on GitHub (including this website!), at https://github.com/nkarve. I'm probably most proud of my state-of-the-art [move generator](https://github.com/nkarve/surge) for chess engines - this was something I spent several months on, shuttling the code between Java, Rust and C before settling on its current incarnation in C++. Some of my other projects include a physics engine and a from-scratch Python [machine learning library](https://github.com/nkarve/twistml): incredibly fast, compact and readable. It boasts a 3 line convolutional forward pass, and I go into depth about the formulation of this algorithm in my very first blog post [here](https://nkarve.github.io/blog/2020/07/07/conv.html). There's quite a few more projects that I plan to add soon (after touching up the readability and structure), including some Game of Life renditions, visualisations of quantum tunnelling and some ab initio quantum chemistry helium simulations. Oh - also be sure to check out the various apps that I developed in Flutter + MySQL + Firebase.

## Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is also great fun. It consists of several hundred mathematical puzzles to be solved via programming, and so it really helps refine one's algorithmic aptitude. To give you a picture of the difficulty scaling, a million people have solved the first problem, but that number dwindles down to a few thousand by problem 130.
