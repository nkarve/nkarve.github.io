My first exposure to physics was *A Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking, which I has first picked up when I was perhaps 8 or 9. Surprisingly, I was not immediately infatuated with physics: I was mostly exploring mathematics and computer science. This was primarily because I did not know of any introductory physics resources, so my knowledge of "actual physics" was only school-level until around 9th grade, although I was, and will always remain, a huge science enthusiast. This was when I found a solid book on Newtonian mechanics, and on completing it, decided to pick up Griffiths' *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* to put my multivariable calculus skills to the test. It was probably midway through this book that it dawned on me that I wanted to pursue a degree at least partly in physics. 

My current interests primarily lie in theoretical high energy physics including (broadly) quantum field theory, gauge theories, particle physics, supersymmetry and string theory. That said, I absolutely love solving classical mechanics and electrodynamics problems, they're great fun and they keep your mind sharp too. Since I'm an avid programmer too, I often try to create simulations and visualisations related to or inspired by my physics learning - some examples include a physics engine and a quantum tunneling simulation. Some of my favourite topics in physics include:

- 2+1D Quantum Gravity and the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence
- Quantum Anomalies
- Non-perturbative phenomena like instantons and D-branes
- 2D Conformal Field Theories
- Holography and Black Hole Thermodynamics
- Solitons in Gauge Theories
- Topological String Theory
- Chiral Perturbation Theory and Large N QCD

On this blog I'll be writing both technical and non-technical accounts of a wide range of physics topics that I find interesting
