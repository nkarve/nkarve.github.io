As you might know, I've [made](https://nkarve.github.io/programming/2021/06/29/physeng1.html) a constraint-based 2D physics engine in Python. Here it is on GitHub: [https://github.com/nkarve/shard](https://github.com/nkarve/shard). On this page I'll be adding some recordings I made of different scenes running the physics engine.
