As you might have surmised from my chess engine escapades, I like chess. I play online chess, on both [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) and [chess.com](https://chess.com), predominantly 3+0, 2+1 and 1+0 games (m+i means initial number of minutes on the timer + number of seconds of increment granted after each move). I would categorise myself as an amateur, but one who is interested in the competitive chess scene as well - I often watch reviews or livestreams of top tier games in tournaments.

Lately I've found myself drawn more towards Lichess, for the sole reason that all of its features are completely free to use (a model which I espouse), the UI is a little cleaner and more responsive, and anonymous games commence much more quickly. I am not experienced enough to embody a particular style of play, but in my own opinion I am a somewhat positional player who enjoys gambits and whose favourite part of the game is the endgame. I relish how taking measured risks early on to gain a surplus of even one pawn through a long-term positional plan can be converted to a winning endgame, it is such a perfect metaphor for life (sorry if this is a clich√©, but I find it quite apt!). Besides, calculating lines and evaluating a position is a healthy way to keep one's memory and analytical skills stimulated. One final lesson (and a very important one at that) was helping me with the age-old adage of trading haste for speed - I have found myself remarkably more patient.

Another great feature provided by both sites is "Puzzle Rush" (or some variant thereof), where one is faced with a series of 2-4 move tactical sequences against the clock. This really triggers the adrenaline flow, and I often outperform my ELO level (when competing against other players) - why? It comes down to one of my refined skills: pattern recognition, something which, on consideration, pervades many of my interests. 

Mathematical and physics problems solving skills are developed, at least early on, through repeated crunching through problem sets, but I would categorise my scientific pattern matching as extending beyond this, into the realm of linking related (or seemingly unrelated!) ideas and topics while learning something new, even from other subjects. In programming this skill pops up while trying to develop an algorithmic solution to a problem. While playing football I can often reflexively predict and parry an attacking player's footwork if I have played against them before. In chess, spotting quick tactical sacrifices becomes quicker and easier. But most importantly, in *real life issues*, intuition and logic cultivated in a completely different setting spring to life and manifest to form creative solutions.
