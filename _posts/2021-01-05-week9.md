My current course of action has inevitably led me to the grand culmination that is string theory. Rather than poring over lecture notes (not really that terse, introductory string theory lecture notes are surprisingly some of the most accessible ones I've seen), I opted for reviews and talks on the string theory and M-theory scene by some of the legends - Polchinski, Schwarz, Witten (actually I was reading his paper on 2+1D topological gravity - the Donoghue papers really piqued my interest in quantum gravity. Sooner or later I'll get to the Jones polynomial one), and lots of semi-popular questions on SE. In terms of complete references, Tong, BBS and Polchinski will be my go-to's, and I'll try and find something for 11D SUGRA. I'm not picking a side here, I just want to appreciate the inherent mathematical beauty behind string theory.  I'll also be trying to learn cohomology properly as well (AT in general), if only to understand the BRST formalism.

Additionally, I was looking at supersymmetric mutiplets and neutralino decay - just some simple BSM stuff, as well as revising $\text{U}(1)$ bundle gauge theory. I was also able to cut down on my CNN forward convolution routine by 80%, and the GPU acceleration was far beyond what I expected - I'm considering write a paper on the algorithm and its formulation!
