I've been working on this app - it's called Mentr, and it's designed to connect mentees with mentors (teachers, parents, alumni, even seniors) in school, replacing what used to be a cumbersome (and virtually non-existent) process. I used Google's cross-platform Flutter toolkit (Android Studio is a hulking mess) along with Firebase, which, of course, integrates really well considering they're both Google products. Although it's not fully functional yet (quite a few features are mock-ups), I think I've managed to carve out a nice style for myself (frankly, I'm quite surprised how it turned out, as I had only a week to belt it out). I even made a voiced-over demo video:
