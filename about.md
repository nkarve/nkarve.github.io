Hi! I'm Nihar Karve, a high school junior (or, I was, when I was maintaining this site). I love maths, physics and computer science, and along with some tutorials, videos and recommendations, I'll be writing both weekly and monthly summaries of my _favourite_ findings and what I've been learning. Hopefully I'll look back on my writing some day and say, "Wow, look how far I've come!" or even better, "lol noob".
