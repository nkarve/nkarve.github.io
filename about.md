Hi! I'm Nihar Karve, a high school junior (or, I was, when I was maintaining this site. I may well be a balding middle-aged man by the time you find this). I love maths, physics, computer science, chemistry and app dev, and along with some cool blog stuff, I'll be writing both weekly and monthly summaries of my  _favourite_ findings. Hopefully I'll look back on my writing some day and say, "Wow, look how far I've come!" or even better, "lol noob".
